introduction to Volcanoes. You've probably heard in the news about volcanic eruptions, or you might remember when Mount St. Helens erupted. ... More violent eruptions occur when pyroclastic material – a mixture of magma, rocks, ash, and hot gases – is exploded upward by pressure caused by underground gases and magma.

What is Volcano explain?
A volcano is a vent in the earth's crust through which lava, rock fragments, hot vapor and gases are ejected. A volcano begins to form when magma, which is hot molten rock from deep within the earth, rises toward the earth's surface and collects in magma chambers.

How are volcanoes caused?
Magma rises through cracks or weaknesses in the Earth's crust. When this pressure is released, eg as a result of plate movement, magma explodes to the surface causing a volcanic eruption. The lava from the eruption cools to form new crust. Over time, after several eruptions, the rock builds up and a volcano forms.
